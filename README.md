# cancel-different-action

This a test repo to know the github action power.

I will add more context to this readme to see how my actions work together.

Currently, Minor Release action force release action with minor input

I need to recreate the next flow:

- Minor release push changes from prerelease/minor to main
- Release action is fired and then canceled by Minor Release
- Minor release fire Release action
